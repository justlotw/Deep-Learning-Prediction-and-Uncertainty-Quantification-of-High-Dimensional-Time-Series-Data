## Installation instructions
If you wish to download the data and run the files, you must create a folder "data" in the root directory or change the target folder in create_data.py. The data can then be installed by running the file generate_data.ipnyb.

For all results in the .ipynb notebooks, they can be saved by creating the appropriate results folders or changing the output location in the save_obj function.
